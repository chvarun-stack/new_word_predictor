My major project is titled Smart Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning.
 The primary objective is to help farmers or agricultural decision-makers 
determine the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental and soil parameters.

For this, I first collected and preprocessed a dataset containing attributes 
such as soil type, pH level, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium content, temperature,
 and rainfall.
 Once the data was cleaned, I applied feature extraction techniques
 to prepare it for machine learning models.

In the backend, I implemented multiple classification algorithms including Naive Bayes,
 Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.
 I also used a Voting Classifier to combine the strengths of these models. 
After evaluation, I found that K-Nearest Neighbors performed best for this 
dataset because it captures local patterns effectively 

The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsiveness.
 Users can input their soil and environmental data through a simple form,
 which sends the data to the backend. 
The backend, built with Django, processes the input,
 uses the trained ML model, and returns whether the suggested crop is suitable or not.

The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with a real-world problem
 and full-stack web development. It can be extended in the future by integrating 
IoT sensors for real-time data collection, building a mobile app version, 
or expanding the dataset for different regions. Overall, this project gave 
me hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model selection, performance evaluation, 
and deploying a machine learning solution in a webÂ application."**
